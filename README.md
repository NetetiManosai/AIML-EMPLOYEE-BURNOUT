PROBLEM STATEMENT :-

Modern organizations are increasingly grappling with the pervasive issue of employee burnout, characterized by ongoing stress, exhaustion, and a loss of enthusiasm. This condition not only affects individual well-being but also has far-reaching implications for organizational efficiency, employee satisfaction, and overall workplace culture.

Leadership Challenges:- Burnout hampers decision-making, strategic planning, and team motivation, particularly affecting those in leadership roles.
Decreased Innovation and Creativity:- Fatigue diminishes the capacity for original thought and creative problem-solving, limiting adaptability to new situation!

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:-

To maintain organizational productivity, uphold professional reputation, and reduce turnover rates, it is imperative to analyze and predict employee burnout. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast burnout by examining various factors, including workload, engagement levels, performance metrics, and organizational support. The goal is to identify employees at risk of burnout and facilitate timely interventions to enhance their well-being and sustain high productivity levels.
